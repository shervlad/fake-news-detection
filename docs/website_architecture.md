## Frontend Architecture

### 1. Component Structure

The frontend follows a component-based architecture with the following organization:

```
src/
├── assets/            # Static assets (images, icons, etc.)
├── components/        # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/        # Generic components (Button, Card, etc.)
│   ├── layout/        # Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
│   └── specific/      # Feature-specific components
├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
├── pages/             # Page components
├── redux/             # Redux store, slices, and actions
├── services/          # API service functions
├── utils/             # Utility functions
├── App.js             # Main application component
└── index.js           # Entry point
```

### 2. Key Pages and Components

#### Public Pages
- **Home Page**: Landing page with introduction and call-to-action
- **About Page**: Information about the project and its mission
- **Browse Page**: Public list of verified fake news with search and filters
- **Submit Page**: Form for submitting potentially fake news
- **Detail Page**: Detailed view of a specific flagged content with verification status

#### Authenticated User Pages
- **Dashboard**: Overview of user's submissions and activity
- **Profile**: User profile management
- **My Submissions**: List of user's submitted flags

#### Moderation Pages
- **Moderation Queue**: List of content waiting for moderation
- **Moderation Detail**: Detailed view for reviewing specific content
- **Moderation Stats**: Statistics and metrics about moderation activities

#### Admin Pages
- **User Management**: Manage user accounts and roles
- **System Settings**: Configure system parameters
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View system-wide statistics and trends

### 3. State Management

Redux is used for global state management with the following slices:

- **Auth Slice**: Manages authentication state (current user, login status)
- **Content Slice**: Manages flagged content data (lists, filters, pagination)
- **Moderation Slice**: Manages moderation queue and actions
- **UI Slice**: Manages UI state (loading indicators, notifications, modals)
- **Settings Slice**: Manages user preferences and settings

### 4. Routing Structure

React Router manages navigation with the following route structure:

```
/                           # Home page
/about                      # About page
/browse                     # Browse flagged content
/content/:id                # Content detail page
/submit                     # Submit form
/auth/login                 # Login page
/auth/register              # Registration page
/auth/forgot-password       # Password recovery
/dashboard                  # User dashboard (authenticated)
/profile                    # User profile (authenticated)
/submissions                # User submissions (authenticated)
/moderation                 # Moderation dashboard (moderators only)
/moderation/queue           # Moderation queue (moderators only)
/moderation/:id             # Moderation detail (moderators only)
/admin                      # Admin dashboard (admins only)
/admin/users                # User management (admins only)
/admin/settings             # System settings (admins only)
```

### 5. Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Frontend sends credentials to `/auth/login` endpoint
3. Backend validates credentials and returns JWT token
4. Frontend stores token in HTTP-only cookie and updates Redux auth state
5. Protected routes check auth state before rendering
6. Axios interceptors add token to API requests
7. Token refresh mechanism handles token expiration

### 6. Key Features Implementation

#### Content Submission Form
- Multi-step form with validation
- URL input with automatic metadata fetching
- Screenshot upload with preview
- Reason selection and additional details
- CAPTCHA for anonymous submissions

#### Content Browsing
- Filterable, sortable list with pagination
- Search functionality (by URL, domain, keywords)
- Card-based UI with thumbnails and key information
- Quick view and detailed view options

#### Moderation Interface
- Split-screen view for efficient review
- Evidence collection tools
- Decision buttons with confidence level selection
- Batch actions for similar content

## Backend Architecture

### 1. Application Structure

The backend follows a modular architecture with the following organization:

```
src/
├── config/             # Configuration files
├── controllers/        # Route handlers
├── middleware/         # Custom middleware
├── models/             # Database models
├── routes/             # API route definitions
├── services/           # Business logic
├── utils/              # Utility functions
├── validators/         # Input validation schemas
├── app.js              # Express application setup
└── server.js           # Entry point
```

### 2. API Structure

The API is organized into logical groups as defined in the API specification:

- `/api/auth`: Authentication endpoints
- `/api/content`: Content management endpoints
- `/api/moderation`: Moderation endpoints
- `/api/extension`: Extension-specific endpoints
- `/api/analytics`: Analytics and statistics endpoints
- `/api/admin`: Administrative endpoints

### 3. Middleware Stack

The Express application uses the following middleware:

1. **Security Middleware**:
   - Helmet (HTTP headers security)
   - CORS configuration
   - Rate limiting
   - Body parsing and sanitization

2. **Authentication Middleware**:
   - JWT verification
   - Role-based access control

3. **Request Processing**:
   - Body parsing (JSON, form data)
   - File upload handling
   - Request logging

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Global error handler
   - Not found handler
   - Validation error formatter

### 4. Database Interaction

MongoDB is used as the primary database with the following approach:

1. **Mongoose Models**: Define schema and validation for each collection
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstract database operations in service layers
3. **Indexes**: Create appropriate indexes for performance
4. **Transactions**: Use transactions for operations that modify multiple documents
5. **Aggregation Pipeline**: Use for complex queries and reporting

### 5. Authentication and Authorization

1. **Authentication**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - OAuth integration (optional)

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control (user, moderator, admin)
   - Resource-based permissions
   - Middleware for protecting routes

### 6. File Storage

For storing screenshots and other media:

1. **Cloud Storage**: AWS S3 or similar service
2. **Local Cache**: Temporary storage for processing
3. **CDN Integration**: For fast delivery of media files
4. **Image Processing**: Resize, compress, and optimize images

### 7. Background Processing

For handling resource-intensive tasks:

1. **Task Queue**: Bull with Redis for job storage
2. **Worker Processes**: Separate processes for handling background jobs
3. **Scheduled Jobs**: Regular tasks like data aggregation and cleanup

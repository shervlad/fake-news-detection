# Fake News Detection System - System Architecture

## Overview

The Fake News Detection System consists of two main components:
1. A Chrome extension that allows users to flag and receive alerts about potentially fake news
2. A companion website that serves as a central hub for submissions, moderation, and browsing flagged content

These components are connected through a shared backend API and database.

## System Components

### 1. Chrome Extension

The Chrome extension follows the Manifest V3 architecture and includes:

- **Popup UI**: The user interface accessible from the Chrome toolbar
- **Content Scripts**: JavaScript that runs in the context of web pages to enable flagging and display alerts
- **Background Service Worker**: Handles background tasks like syncing with the backend and managing alerts
- **Storage**: Local storage for caching flagged content and user preferences

### 2. Website Frontend

The website frontend is a responsive web application that includes:

- **Public Pages**: Landing page, about page, and browsable list of flagged content
- **Submission Form**: Interface for submitting potentially fake news
- **Search Functionality**: Allows users to search for flagged content
- **User Authentication**: Login/registration system for users who want to track their submissions
- **Moderation Dashboard**: Interface for moderators to review and verify submissions

### 3. Backend API

The backend API handles:

- **Content Submission**: Receiving and storing flagged content
- **Content Retrieval**: Providing data to the extension and website
- **Authentication**: Managing user accounts and sessions
- **Moderation**: Tools for reviewing and categorizing submissions

### 4. Database

The database stores:

- Flagged content information
- User accounts
- Moderation actions
- Analytics data

## Data Flow

1. **Flagging Content**:
   - User flags content via Chrome extension or website
   - Request is sent to backend API
   - Content is stored in database
   - Moderation queue is updated

2. **Viewing Flagged Content**:
   - Chrome extension periodically syncs with backend
   - When user visits a page, extension checks if content is flagged
   - If flagged, alert is displayed to user

3. **Moderation**:
   - Moderators review submissions through website dashboard
   - Verified flags are marked as such in database
   - Chrome extension prioritizes verified flags in alerts

## Database Schema

### Content Table
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `url`: URL of the flagged content
- `title`: Title or headline of the content
- `content_snippet`: Brief excerpt of the content
- `screenshot_url`: URL to stored screenshot (if provided)
- `domain`: Domain of the flagged content
- `platform_type`: Type of platform (social media, news site, etc.)
- `created_at`: Timestamp of submission
- `status`: Current status (pending, verified, rejected)
- `verification_score`: Score indicating likelihood of being fake news

### Flags Table
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `content_id`: Reference to Content table
- `user_id`: Reference to User table (if authenticated)
- `anonymous_id`: Identifier for anonymous submissions
- `reason`: Reason for flagging
- `additional_info`: Additional information provided by flagger
- `created_at`: Timestamp of flag

### Users Table
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `email`: User email
- `password_hash`: Hashed password
- `role`: User role (user, moderator, admin)
- `created_at`: Account creation timestamp
- `last_login`: Last login timestamp

### Moderation Table
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `content_id`: Reference to Content table
- `moderator_id`: Reference to User table
- `decision`: Moderation decision
- `notes`: Moderator notes
- `created_at`: Timestamp of moderation action

## API Endpoints

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register`: Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login`: User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout`: User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me`: Get current user info

### Content Endpoints
- `POST /api/content`: Submit new flagged content
- `GET /api/content`: Get list of flagged content (with filters)
- `GET /api/content/:id`: Get specific flagged content
- `GET /api/content/check`: Check if URL is flagged

### Moderation Endpoints
- `GET /api/moderation/queue`: Get moderation queue
- `POST /api/moderation/:id/decision`: Submit moderation decision
- `GET /api/moderation/stats`: Get moderation statistics

### Extension Endpoints
- `POST /api/extension/sync`: Sync extension with backend
- `POST /api/extension/flag`: Submit flag from extension
- `GET /api/extension/check-batch`: Check multiple URLs at once

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Secure password storage with bcrypt

2. **Data Protection**:
   - HTTPS for all communications
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Protection against SQL injection and XSS

3. **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention**:
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints
   - CAPTCHA for anonymous submissions
   - IP-based blocking for abuse

4. **Privacy**:
   - Option for anonymous submissions
   - Compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations
   - Clear privacy policy

## Technology Stack

### Chrome Extension
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- Chrome Extension API (Manifest V3)

### Website Frontend
- React.js
- Redux for state management
- Material-UI for components
- Axios for API requests

### Backend API
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB for database
- JWT for authentication
- Multer for file uploads

### Infrastructure
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Database Scaling**:
   - Sharding for horizontal scaling
   - Caching frequently accessed data
   - Indexing for performance

2. **API Scaling**:
   - Load balancing
   - Microservices architecture for specific functions
   - CDN for static assets

3. **Extension Performance**:
   - Local caching of frequently visited domains
   - Batch processing for sync operations
   - Efficient DOM manipulation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Automated content analysis
   - Prediction of fake news likelihood
   - Content clustering for similar misinformation

2. **Additional Platforms**:
   - Firefox extension
   - Mobile applications
   - Browser-agnostic solutions

3. **Community Features**:
   - User reputation system
   - Community moderation
   - Educational resources about media literacy
